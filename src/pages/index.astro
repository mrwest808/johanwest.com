  <p>Hello there!</p>
  <p>
    I'm a versatile software developer based in Stockholm, Sweden <span
      role="img"
      aria-label="flag of sweden">ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª</span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    My core expertise leans towards the front-end side of web development,
    although I am comfortable across the stack. I've worked within the Node.js
    ecosystem since 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm equally passionate about creating great user experiences as developer
    experiences. Whenever I have some downtime I often find myself tinkering
    with internal tooling to make the work day of myself and my colleagues more
    convenient.
  </p>
